# Hello, my friend! ðŸ‘‹
I like **code** and **poetry**, and I often spend a whole day in the library.  If you have the same hobby, then we are really lucky!

I have been familiar with common languages â€‹â€‹and have used many frameworks, such as C / C++ / C# / .NET / MFC / Qt5 / UWP / Java / Python / JavaScript / Php / SQL / R / Kafka / MongoDB / WxApp.  I have participated in many collaborative projects.  If we have the opportunity to cooperate, I think I should be able to integrate well.

For the professional side, I have tried **complex event processing**, **machine learning**, **brain-computer interface** and **IoT control**. In terms of machine learning, I am studying CNN / LSTM / SVM / DCRNN etc. Any related academic discussions are welcome.
